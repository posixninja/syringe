What is syringe?

	Syringe is the "Injector" module from GreenPois0n. It's used for sending exploits to the device 
	and booting the device out of recovery mode, and into a jailbroken state, whether to a ramdisk 
	or to the main filesystem.

Building with Autotools
-----------------------

Syringe now uses a standard Autoconf/Automake toolchain.  A typical
build looks like:

```
$ ./autogen.sh          # generates configure & friends
$ ./configure           # add --prefix, --host, etc. if needed
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Required dependencies:

- pkg-config
- libusb-1.0 (headers + shared library)
- libcurl
- zlib
- `xxd` (bundled with Vim, used to turn payload blobs into headers)
- An ARM toolchain capable of assembling the exploit payloads.  By
  default we expect `arm-elf-as` and `arm-elf-objcopy`, but you can
  override them on the configure command line, e.g.:

```
$ ARM_AS=arm-none-eabi-as ARM_OBJCOPY=arm-none-eabi-objcopy ./configure
```

To speed up iterative hacking, you can also skip `autogen.sh` after the
first run and just re-run `configure` whenever you change
`config.status` inputs.
